# STM32 Altium Designer Library Collect

## About it
These repository collect library from [Altium Designer official website](https://designcontent.live.altium.com/#ReferenceDesigns). I don't know if it is reasonable and legal and I can't find any license about it. But I consider you download the newest one from the link I have given.

For now I just collect several series:

> STMicroelectronics_STM32_F0_181213
> STMicroelectronics_STM32_F1_181213
> STMicroelectronics_STM32_F2_181213
> STMicroelectronics_STM32_F3_181213
> STMicroelectronics_STM32_F4_181213
> STMicroelectronics_STM32_L1_120614
> STMicroelectronics_STM32W_181213


And I believe the number (like 181213)  of every series is the release data. For convient to update, I just give the series name on my repository. 

## The plan
I will update some new devices if I find it needs.
